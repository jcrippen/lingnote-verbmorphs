	\end{itemize}

	can occur together with qualifier \X[ÿa-qual]{ÿa-} of unknown meaning

\item[ÿa-]\label{m:ÿa-qual}
	qualifier of unknown meaning;
	can occur together with incorporated noun \X[ÿa-face]{ÿa-} ‘face’

\item[ÿaa=]\label{m:ÿaa=along}
	directional preverb indicating progression or movement along a space
	(compare \fm{\rt[²]{ÿa}} ‘move’,
		directional noun \fm{diÿáa} ‘across, other side’,
		\fm{niÿaa} ‘direction’);
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item	progression, used in progressive aspect for \fm{∅} and \fm{n} conjugation class verbs
		\begin{itemize}
		\item	\fm{yaa x̱at nalnítl} (prog; obj intr, \fm{∅}, ach) ‘I am getting fat’\newline
			versus \fm{x̱at wudlinítl} (pfv) ‘I got fat’
		\end{itemize}
	\item	movement along a space
		\begin{enumerate}

		\item	motion derivation
				\fm{ÿaa} \~\ \fm{ÿa-u-} (\fm{∅}, \fm{-ch} rep) ‘obliquely, circuitously’
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}

\item[ÿaa=]\label{m:ÿaa=mind}
	preverb indicating mental phenomenon, limited to a couple of verbs;
	uncertain if it can occur together with \fm{ÿaa} ‘along’;
	possibly related to Proto-Dene \fm[*]{yən-} \~\ \fm[*]{yiːn-} ‘mind’ and Eyak \fm{ʔiːlih} ‘mind’

\item[ÿaan=]
	incorporated noun indicating hunger,
	saturates object argument;

	\item	\fm{ax̱ éet yaan uwaháa} (pfv; obj intr, \fm{∅}, mot) ‘hunger appeared to me’ (i.e.\ ‘I got hungry’)\newline
		(not \fm[*]{yaan ax̱ éet uwaháa})
	\end{itemize}

\item[ÿan=]
	directional preverb indicating motion to shore, motion to ground, or termination;
	allomorphs are \fm{ÿax̱} and \fm{ÿánde}:
		\fm{ÿax̱} is used with repetitive,
		\fm{ÿánde} with progressive and prospective,
		and \fm{ÿan} elsewhere (e.g.\ pfv, imp);
	morphologically a specialization of the
		\fm{NP-\{t,x̱,dé\}} (\fm{∅}, \fm{-μμL} rep) ‘arriving at NP’
		motion derivation,
	so the \fm{ÿan} probably used to end with \fm{-t} ‘to a point’ punctual postposition
		as \fm[*]{ÿant};
	derived from noun \fm{ÿán} ‘shore’
		(< Pre-Tlingit \fm[*]{ŋanʰ} < Proto-Na-Dene \fm[*]{ŋənˀ} ‘ground, earth’)
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item	motion on water to shore,
		can be translated ‘ashore’;
		motion derivation
			\fm{ÿan} / \fm{yax̱} / \fm{ÿánde} (\fm{∅}, \fm{-μμL} rep) ‘ashore’
	\item	motion to ground or other horizontal surface,
		can be translated ‘down’ or ‘on ground’;
		motion derivation
			\fm{ÿan} / \fm{yax̱} / \fm{ÿánde} (\fm{∅}, \fm{-μμL} rep) ‘on ground’
			optionally with incorporates (\fm{kʼi-} ‘base’ for ‘setting up, erecting’,
			\fm{sha-} ‘head’ for ‘leaning against’)
	\item	termination of eventuality,
		can be translated ‘ending, terminating, finishing’;
		eventuality/motion derivation
			\fm{ÿan} \~\ \fm{yax̱} \~\ \fm{ÿánde} (\fm{∅}, \fm{-μμL} rep) ‘ending, finishing’
			optionally with \fm{NP-xʼ} ‘coming to rest at NP’;
		derives from metaphor of ‘shore’ as ‘end of journey’ and thus ‘end of event’
	\end{enumerate}

\item[ÿánde=]
	allomorph of directional preverb \fm{ÿan} ‘ashore’ or ‘ending’
	with allative postposition \fm{-dé} \~\ \fm{-de} ‘toward’
	\begin{itemize}
	\item	\fm{yánde gax̱tooḵóox̱} (prosp; subj intr, \fm{∅}, mot) ‘we are going to boat ashore’\newline
		versus \fm{yan wutuwaḵúx̱} (pfv) ‘we boated ashore’
	\end{itemize}

\item[ÿata=]
	incorporated noun ‘sleep’,
	saturates object argument;
	apparently derived from \fm{ÿá} ‘face’ and \fm{\rt[¹]{taᴸ}} ‘sg.\ sleep’
	\begin{itemize}
	\item	\fm{ax̱ éet yataawaháa} (pfv; obj intr, \fm{∅}, mot) ‘sleep appeared to me’, i.e. ‘I got sleepy’
	\item	\fm{ax̱ yaadáx̱ yataawahaa} (pfv; obj intr, \fm{g̱}, mot) ‘sleep disappeared from my face’,
		i.e.\ ‘I became wakeful’
	\end{itemize}

\item[ÿax̱=]\label{m:ÿax̱=ashore}
	allomorph of directional preverb \fm{ÿan} ‘ashore’ or ‘ending’ (group E)
	with perlative postposition \fm{-x̱} ‘contacting’;
	used only with repetitive versus \fm{ÿánde} (prog, prosp) or \fm{ÿan} (pfv, imp, etc.)
	\begin{itemize}
	\item	\fm{yax̱ tooḵoox̱} (rep impfv; subj intr, \fm{∅}, mot) ‘we repeatedly boat ashore’\newline
		versus \fm{yan wutuwaḵúx̱} (pfv) ‘we boated ashore’
	\end{itemize}

\item[ÿax̱=]\label{m:ÿax̱=exh}
	manner preverb ‘using up, completely’ occuring as part of exhaustive derivation
		\motderiv{ÿax̱= + ÿa- + s-}{\fm{∅}, \fm{-x̱} rep}{affecting all of, using up};
	possibly could be equated with \X[ÿax̱=facing]{ÿax̱=} ‘facing’
		but the two meanings seem to be distinct;
	not directly related to \X[ÿax̱=ashore]{ÿax̱=} which is instead from the noun \fm{ÿán} ‘shore’

\item[ÿax̱=]\label{m:ÿax̱=facing}
	directional preverb ‘facing’ occurring as part of the motion derivation
		\motderiv{NP-xʼ ÿax̱=}{\fm{∅}, \fm{-x̱} rep}{turning over by NP}
		and its further derivations \fm{áa ÿax̱=} ‘turning over’ with \fm{á} ‘there’
		and \fm{shóo ÿax̱=} ‘turning end over end’ with \fm{shú} ‘end’;
	the meaning ‘facing’ is tentatively supposed from its likely etymology of
		the inalienable noun \fm{ÿá} ‘face’ and pertingent postposition \fm{-x̱}
	possibly could be equated with \X[ÿax̱=exh]{ÿax̱=} ‘exhaustively, using up’
		but the two meanings seem to be distinct;
	not directly related to \X[ÿax̱=ashore]{ÿax̱=} which is instead from the noun \fm{ÿán} ‘shore’
